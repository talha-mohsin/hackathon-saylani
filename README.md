Hiring Mine UI – Hackathon Submission

This project was created as part of a hackathon challenge where I built a fully responsive and user-friendly Hiring Mine UI.
It includes:
Structured layout using HTML
Modern and responsive styling with CSS & Bootstrap
Version control and collaboration workflow with Git & GitHub
This task enhanced my frontend development abilities and strengthened my understanding of UI design, responsiveness, and clean code structure.
